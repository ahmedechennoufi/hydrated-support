        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Hydrated is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information to provide you with the best hydration tracking experience:</p>
        <p><strong>Personal Profile Data:</strong> Age, sex, weight, height, activity level, and climate preferences that you voluntarily provide to calculate personalized hydration goals.</p>
        <p><strong>Hydration Data:</strong> Your logged beverage entries, daily goals, and progress statistics.</p>
        <p><strong>App Usage Data:</strong> Basic analytics about how you use the app to improve our features (this data is anonymized and cannot be linked to you personally).</p>

        <h2>2. How We Store Your Data</h2>
        <p>All your personal hydration data is stored locally on your device using iOS's secure storage systems. We do not transmit your personal hydration tracking data to our servers or any third parties.</p>
        <p>Your data remains on your device and is protected by your device's security measures including passcodes, Touch ID, or Face ID.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Your hydration data stays private and is only accessible to you on your device.</p>
        <p>We may share anonymized, aggregated usage statistics that cannot be linked to individual users to improve our app features.</p>

        <h2>4. Premium Features and In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>If you purchase premium features, the transaction is processed through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple handles all payment processing according to their privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>5. Health Data</h2>
        <p>Hydrated may integrate with Apple HealthKit (if you choose to enable this feature). Any health data shared with HealthKit is governed by Apple's privacy policy and your HealthKit privacy settings.</p>
        <p>You can control what data, if any, is shared with HealthKit through the app's settings and your device's privacy settings.</p>

        <h2>6. Analytics and Crash Reporting</h2>
        <p>We may collect anonymized analytics and crash reports to help us improve the app's performance and fix bugs. This data does not include any personal information or hydration tracking data.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our app is not designed for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data. Since your data is stored locally on your device, we recommend keeping your device secure with appropriate locks and security features.</p>

        <h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Your data is stored on your device until you delete the app or manually clear the data through the app's settings. You can delete all your data at any time by deleting the app from your device.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
